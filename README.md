# Pubbot
A discord bot that allows user to generate a color-based role on the server that the bot is on. The accepted format of the color includes the Hexadecimal representation of the color.

The bot also makes use of a Web API to get information about drinks with the name of the drink, which the user supplies, as a command argument. Then it parses the information returned by the API and formats the information to display it on the user's end.
This includes:
- Description of the drink
- Name of the drink
- Detailed instructions on how the drink is made

There may or may not be more additions and changes to the bot in the future.
